#Hello,

This is my first project that I created and was influnced by tutorials online.

I just made some modifications to it :-)

solidity is a language I took interest in it, and decided to try it out and read some of the documentation and tutorials online provided by  @"Ethereum.org" website

so the code is not perfect but Im still new to this space thanks for checking it out!
